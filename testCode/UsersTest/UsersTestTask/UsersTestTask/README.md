# UsersTestTask

Implemented: users-list, user crud, add/remove permission pages
Not implemented: users table paging, sorting, filtering

Full disclosure, I got rusty with angular, and totally overestimated my current memory of working with it.
I was not able to commit whole 48 hours to the task. Took me 2 hours for the service, and about 8-10 hours for the implemented UI part.

I would love to have a change to discuss further modifications, and authentication implementation for the task.
